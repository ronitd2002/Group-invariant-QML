    "\n",
    "Symmetries are at the heart of physics. Indeed in condensed matter and\n",
    "particle physics we often define a thing simply by the symmetries it\n",
    "adheres to. What does symmetry mean for those in machine learning? In\n",
    "this context the ambition is straightforward --- it is a means to reduce\n",
    "the parameter space and improve the trained model\\'s ability to\n",
    "sucessfully label unseen data, i.e., its ability to generalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a learning task and the data we are learning from has an\n",
    "underlying symmetry. For example, consider a game of Noughts and Crosses\n",
    "(aka Tic-tac-toe): if we win a game, we would have won it if the board\n",
    "was rotated or flipped along any of the lines of symmetry. Now if we\n",
    "want to train an algorithm to spot the outcome of these games, we can\n",
    "either ignore the existence of this symmetry or we can somehow include\n",
    "it. The advantage of paying attention to the symmetry is it identifies\n",
    "multiple configurations of the board as \\'the same thing\\' as far as the\n",
    "symmetry is concerned. This means we can reduce our parameter space, and\n",
    "so the amount of data our algorithm must sift through is immediately\n",
    "reduced. Along the way, the fact that our learning model must encode a\n",
    "symmetry that actually exists in the system we are trying to represent\n",
    "naturally encourages our results to be more generalisable. The encoding\n",
    "of symmetries into our learning models is where the term *equivariance*\n",
    "will appear. We will see that demanding that certain symmetries are\n",
    "included in our models means that the mappings that make up our\n",
    "algorithms must be such that we could transform our input data with\n",
    "respect to a certain symmetry, then apply our mappings, and this would\n",
    "be the same as applying the mappings and then transforming the output\n",
    "data with the same symmetry. This is the technical property that gives\n",
    "us the name \\\"equavariant learning\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical machine learning, this area is often referred to as\n",
    "geometric deep learning (GDL) due to the traditional association of\n",
    "symmetry to the world of geometry, and the fact that these\n",
    "considerations usually focus on deep neural networks (see or for a broad\n",
    "introduction). We will refer to the quantum computing version of this as\n",
    "*quantum geometric machine learning* (QGML).\n",

    "Representation theory in circuits\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to discuss is how do we work with symmetries in the\n",
    "first place? The answer lies in the world of group representation\n",
    "theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let\\'s define what we mean by a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation on\n",
    "$G$, here denoted $\\circ$, that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to\n",
    "form an element of $G$, denoted $a \\circ b$, such that the following\n",
    "three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c$ in $G$, one has\n",
    "    $(a \\circ b) \\circ c=a \\circ (b \\circ c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Identity element**: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that, for every $a$ in $G$, one\n",
    "\n",
    "    :   has $e \\circ a=a$ and $a \\circ e=a$. Such an element is unique.\n",
    "        It is called the identity element of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Inverse element**: For each $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "    :   such that $a \\circ b=e$ and $b \\circ a=e$, where $e$ is the\n",
    "        identity element. For each $a$, the element $b$ is unique: it is\n",
    "        called the inverse of $a$ and is commonly denoted $a^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With groups defined, we are in a position to articulate what a\n",
    "representation is: Let $\\varphi$ be a map sending $g$ in group $G$ to a\n",
    "linear map $\\varphi(g): V \\rightarrow V$, for some vector space $V$,\n",
    "which satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varphi\\left(g_{1} g_{2}\\right)=\\varphi\\left(g_{1}\\right) \\circ \\varphi\\left(g_{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { for all } g_{1}, g_{2} \\in G.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that just as elements in a group act on each other to\n",
    "reach further elements, i.e., $g\\circ h = k$, a representation sends us\n",
    "to a mapping acting on a vector space such that\n",
    "$\\varphi(g)\\circ \\varphi(h) = \\varphi(k)$. In this way we are\n",
    "representing the structure of the group as a linear map. For a\n",
    "representation, our mapping must send us to the general linear group\n",
    "$GL(n)$ (the space of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices with matrix\n",
    "multiplication as the group multiplication). Note how this is both a\n",
    "group, and by virtue of being a collection of invertible matrices, also\n",
    "a set of linear maps (they\\'re all invertble matrices that can act on\n",
    "row vectors). Fundamentally, representation theory is based on the\n",
    "prosaic observation that linear algebra is easy and group theory is\n",
    "abstract. So what if we can study groups via linear maps?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now due to the importance of unitarity in quantum mechnics, we are\n",
    "particularly interested in the unitary representations: representations\n",
    "where the linear maps are unitary matrices. If we can identify these\n",
    "then we will have a way to naturally encode groups in quantum circuits\n",
    "(which are mostly made up of unitary gates).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../_static/demonstration_assets/geometric_qml/sphere_equivariant.png){.align-center\n",
    "width=\"45.0%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "How does all this relate to symmetries? Well, a large class of\n",
    "symmetries can be characterised as a group, where all the elements of\n",
    "the group leave some space we are considering unchanged. Let\\'s consider\n",
    "an example: the symmetries of a sphere. Now when we think of this\n",
    "symmetry we probably think something along the lines of \\\"it\\'s the same\n",
    "no matter how we rotate it, or flip it left to right, etc\\\". There is\n",
    "this idea of being invariant under some operation. We also have the idea\n",
    "of being able to undo these actions: if we rotate one way, we can rotate\n",
    "it back. If we flip the sphere right-to-left we can flip it\n",
    "left-to-right to get back to where we started (notice too all these\n",
    "inverses are unique). Trivially we can also do nothing. What exactly are\n",
    "we describing here? We have elements that correspond to an action on a\n",
    "sphere that can be inverted and for which there exists an identity. It\n",
    "is also trivially the case here that if we consider three operations a,\n",
    "b, c from the set of rotations and reflections of the sphere, that if we\n",
    "combine two of them together then\n",
    "$a\\circ (b \\circ c) = (a\\circ b) \\circ c$. The operations are\n",
    "associative. These features turn out to literally define a group!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we\\'ve seen the group in itself is a very abstract creature; this is\n",
    "why we look to its representations. The group labels what symmetries we\n",
    "care about, they tell us the mappings that our system is invariant\n",
    "under, and the unitary representations show us how those symmetries look\n",
    "on a particular space of unitary matrices. If we want to encode the\n",
    "structure of the symmeteries in a quantum circuit we must restrict our\n",
    "gates to being unitary representations of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "There remains one question: *what is equivariance?* With our newfound\n",
    "knowledge of group representation theory we are ready to tackle this.\n",
    "Let $G$ be our group, and $V$ and $W$, with elements $v$ and $w$\n",
    "respectively, be vector spaces over some field $F$ with a map $f$\n",
    "between them. Suppose we have representations\n",
    "$\\varphi: G \\rightarrow GL(V)$ and $\\psi: G \\rightarrow GL(W)$.\n",
    "Furthermore, let\\'s write $\\varphi_g$ for the representation of $g$ as a\n",
    "linear map on $V$ and $\\psi_g$ as the same group element represented as\n",
    "a linear map on $W$ respectively. We call $f$ *equivariant* if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\varphi_g(v))=\\psi_g(f(v)) \\quad \\text { for all } g\\in G.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of such a map in machine learning is that if, for\n",
    "example, our neural network layers are equivariant maps then two inputs\n",
    "that are related by some intrinsic symmetry (maybe they are reflections)\n",
    "preserve this information in the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following figure for example. What we see is a board with a\n",
    "cross in a certain square on the left and some numerical encoding of\n",
    "this on the right, where the 1 is where the X is in the number grid. We\n",
    "present an equivariant mapping between these two spaces with respect to\n",
    "a group action that is a rotation or a swap (here a $\\pi$ rotation). We\n",
    "can either apply a group action to the original grid and then map to the\n",
    "number grid, or we could map to the number grid and then apply the group\n",
    "action. Equivariance demands that the result of either of these\n",
    "procedures should be the same.\n",
